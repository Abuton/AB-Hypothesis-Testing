A repository for Machine Learning Models and A/B Testing


## A/B Hypothesis Testing: Ad campaign performance  

### Project Overview 
SmartAd is a mobile first advertiser agency. It designs Intuitive touch-enabled advertising. It provides brands with an automated advertising experience via machine learning and creative excellence. Their company is based on the principle of voluntary                         
participation which is proven to increase brand engagement and memorability 10 x more than static alternatives. SmartAd provides an additional service called Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), a                     
lightweight questionnaire, served with every campaign to determine the impact of the creative, the ad they design, on various upper funnel metrics, including memorability and                         
brand sentiment. As a data scientist in SmartAd, one of your tasks is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign                         
resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness. 

### Machine Learning For Hypothesis Testing
This file contains the ML models built which include:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Tree Classifier
  3. XGBoost Classifier
  
 Problem Statement
Given the data to an experiment ran by SmartAd to verify the likelihood of users to click yes to the Question: Do you Know SmartAd?. Build A Machine Learning Model to predict the likelihood of a user to click the yes radio button in answering the question

**Target Column**: yes

Model Loss Function = LogLoss

### A-B Hypothesis Testing
